This are the solutions for course of Algorithms and Data Structures.
Core ideas behind each of the problem:
* lab1 - Prefix/Suffix totals.
* lab2 - Dynamic programming.
* lab3 - Manipulations on bit.
* lab4 - Simple interval tree.
* lab5 - Managing intervals on the set.
* lab6 - LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
* lab7 - Use of Priority Queue
* lab8 - Uses Dijkstra's algorithm on a specific graph.
* zal1 - Dynamic programming with two iterators.
* zal2 -
